          <li>1 cup of Goat Cheese, room temperature</li>
          <li>1 Half cup balsamic vinegar</li>

         <li>Heat vinegar in a small skillet over medium-low heat. Simmer until reduced by about half, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from heat and allow to cool to room temperature.</li>
         <li>Prepare a grill for high heat. Place bread slices on a foil-lined baking sheet and drizzle with olive oil. (A skillet will work fine for this as well if you do not have a grill)</li>
         <li>Combine strawberries and thyme in a small bowl and set aside.</li>
         <li>Grill bread on the preheated grill or skillet until browned, about 3 minutes per side.</li>
         <li>Spread goat cheese on toasted bread. Add black pepper, salt, and reduced vinegar to the strawberry mixture. Spoon over the goat cheese topped bruschetta. Garnish with additional thyme</li>
     </ol> 
    <p><strong><em>Voila!</em></strong> You now have a delicious appetizer to impress your guests with! This dish can also serve as a desert of sorts as well, just reduce the amount of vinegar used with the strawberries!</p>
