 <h3>May I introduce you to one of the most <em>stunning</em> and <em>delicious</em> cocktails out there!</h3>
  <p>This cocktail is the classic whiskey sour that is given another layer of <em>pizzaz</em> on top to enhance the overall experience.</p>
   <h4>What you will need</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 ounces bourbon whiskey: as high quality as possible (you can use any whiskey, I just prefer the flavor of bourbon)</li>
        <li>1 ounce lemon juice</li>
        <li>3/4 ounce simple syrup (I recommend maple syrup)</li>
        <li>1/2 ounce red wine</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>How to make</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Add the whiskey, lemon juice, simple (or maple) syrup into a shaker with ice and shake hard until-well chilled.</li>
        <li>Strain into glass over fresh ice</li>
        <li>Slowly pour the red wine over the back of a spoon so that the wine floats on top of the drink</li>
    </ol>
    <p>This cocktail is definitely one of the most <strong><em>bangin'</em></strong> cocktails out there. I prefer the addition of maple syrup to the drink rather than simple syrup, this is because maple syrup is a natural sweetener that isnt extremely overpowering, and can actually add a more complex profile to the drink.</p>
